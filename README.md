## The #48in24 Challenge

The goal is to tackle a different programming challenge each week, exploring how it can be solved using various programming languages and paradigms.

Each week focuses on a new exercise, aiming to build programming skills incrementally. The challenge encourages experimenting with different approaches and languages to find diverse solutions.

- Week 1 - [Leap](https://exercism.org/exercises/leap): `Python`, `Clojure` and `MIPS Assembly`.
